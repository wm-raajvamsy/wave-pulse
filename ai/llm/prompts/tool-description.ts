export const UI_LAYER_DATA_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = `Get UI Layer data including console logs, network requests, component tree properties, timeline events, storage data, and application/platform information. Use this to monitor application state, debug issues, analyze UI component structure, determine application load times, inspect storage (localStorage, sessionStorage, etc.), or retrieve application and platform details. Timeline events include APP_STARTUP which directly shows application load time (in milliseconds). Network requests can also be used to calculate load times by examining request timestamps and durations. Always use available tools to answer questions about console errors, network activity, performance metrics, load times, component structure, storage contents, or application/platform information. For questions about application load time, use dataType "timeline" to get APP_STARTUP events. When users ask about the "selected element", "current element", "selected item in element tree", "properties of the selected item", or "styles of the selected item", use dataType "components" to get the component tree, then search recursively through the componentTree for any node where the "selected" property is true - that is the currently selected element in the element tree. The selected element will have a "properties" object and a "styles" object attached to it. The "properties" object is a simple key-value dictionary where property names (like "scrollable", "disabled", "show", "name", "classname", etc.) map directly to their values. To answer questions about specific widget properties (e.g., "what is the scrollable value?"), directly access the property from the properties object using properties["propertyName"] or properties.propertyName. The "styles" object contains style information with CSS-like properties organized by selectors. Both objects can be used to answer questions about widget properties and styling. For questions about storage data (localStorage, sessionStorage values, stored preferences, etc.), use dataType "storage" to get all storage entries. For questions about application information (app name, version, theme, locale, server path, security settings) or platform information (OS, device, version), use dataType "info" to get both appInfo and platformInfo.`;
