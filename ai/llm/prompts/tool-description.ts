export const UI_LAYER_DATA_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = `Get UI Layer data including console logs, network requests, component tree properties, and timeline events. Use this to monitor application state, debug issues, analyze UI component structure, or determine application load times. Timeline events include APP_STARTUP which directly shows application load time (in milliseconds). Network requests can also be used to calculate load times by examining request timestamps and durations. Always use available tools to answer questions about console errors, network activity, performance metrics, load times, or component structure. For questions about application load time, use dataType "timeline" to get APP_STARTUP events. When users ask about the "selected element", "current element", "selected item in element tree", "properties of the selected item", or "styles of the selected item", use dataType "components" to get the component tree, then search recursively through the componentTree for any node where the "selected" property is true - that is the currently selected element in the element tree. The selected element will have "properties" (containing all widget properties like classname, iconclass, caption, etc.) and "styles" (containing style information with CSS-like properties organized by selectors) attached to it, which you can use to answer questions about widget properties and styling.`;
